# Contributing Guide


## Code of conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [hello@radixdlt.com](mailto:hello@radixdlt.com).


## Getting started

### Reporting an issue

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-scrypto/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-scrypto/issues/new). Be sure to include:
  * a **title**,
  * a **clear description**,
  * as much **relevant information** as possible,
  * a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Workflows

Development flow:
1. Create feature branches using develop as a starting point to start new work;
1. Submit a new pull request to the `develop` branch
   * please ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution and include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Release workflow:
1. Create a release branch;
1. Tag the commit on Github releases;
1. Update `main` branch to point to the "newest" release (by version number);
1. Update `docs` branch to include documentation based on the "newest" release (by version number).

### Workspace Setup (macOS)

1. Install brew package manager
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Install `llvm`, `cmake` and `binaryen`
   ```bash
   brew install llvm cmake binaryen
   ```
3. Install Rust toolchain
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   rustup +nightly target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```
4. Install Scrypto CLIs
   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-scrypto --branch develop simulator
   ```
5. (Recommended) Install VSCode and the following plugins
   * [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
   * [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb)
   * [crates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=serayuzgur.crates)
   * [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
   * [Radix Transaction Manifest Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RadixPublishing.radix-transaction-manifest-support)
   * [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
6. (Optional) Install `cargo nextest` to speedup test execution time
    Installation
    ```
    cargo install cargo-nextest
    ```
    more details: [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/index.html)
7. (Optional) Install `sccache` to speedup compilation times.
    * Installation
    ```
    cargo install sccache
    ```
    * Configuration\
      Two options available:
      - via environmental variable:\
        bash:
        ```bash
        echo 'export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache' >> ~/.profile
        ```
        zsh:
        ```zsh
        echo 'export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache' >> ~/.zshrc
        ```
      - via cargo configuration file
        define `build.rustc-wrapper` in the cargo configuration file. For example, you can set it globally in `$HOME/.cargo/config.toml` by adding:
        ```
        [build]
        rustc-wrapper = "/path/to/sccache"
        ```
    more details: [sccache - Shared Compilation Cache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache)


Bash scripts that might be of help:
* `format.sh` - Formats the entire repo
* `build.sh` - Builds main packages
* `test.sh` - Runs the essential tests
* `test_extra.sh` - Runs the additional tests
* `assets/update-assets.sh` - Updates `Account`/`Faucet` scrypto packages (needed when your change would affect the output WASM)

## Branching strategy

### Branches

* Feature - `feature/cool-bananas`
* Development  - `develop`
* Release - `release/0.1.0`
* Hotfix - `release/0.1.1`

Branch `main` always points to the latest release.

#### Features

Feature branches are where the main work happens. The goal is to keep them as independent from each other as possible. They can be based on a previous release or from develop.

> develop branch is not a place to dump WIP features

Itâ€™s important to remark that feature branches should only be merged to develop once they are complete and ideally tested in a test network.

#### Develop

This branch acts as staging for new releases, and are where most of QA should happen.

When QA gives the green light, a new release branch is created

#### Releases

These branches will stay alive forever, or at least while we support the release, thereby allowing us to release security hotfixes for older versions.

If QA discovers a bug with any of the features before a release happens, it is fixed in the feature branch taken from the release branch and then merged into the release again.

These changes should immediately be propagated to the current release candidate branch.

#### Hotfixes

Hotfix branches are for providing emergency security fixes to older versions and should be treated like release branches.

The hotifx should be created for the oldest affected release, and then merged downstream into the next release or release candidate, repeated until up to date.


## Conventions

### Code style

We use the default code style specified by [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt).

A convenience script is also provided to format the whole code base:

```
./format.sh
```

You're also highly recommended to install the git hooks

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Commit messages

Please follow the convention below for commit messages:

*  Separate subject from body with a blank line
*  Limit the subject line to 50 characters
*  Capitalise the subject line
*  Do not end the subject line with a period
*  Use the imperative mood in the subject line
*  Wrap the body at 72 characters
*  Use the body to explain what and why vs. how, separating paragraphs with an empty line.

### Deterministic execution

Since the Radix Engine is used in a consensus-driven environment, all results of a particular
transaction (e.g. final state changes and emitted events) must always be exactly the same, no matter
where and when the transaction is executed.

However, some wide-spread programming concepts and data structures are inherently non-deterministic,
so - by convention - we choose to **not** use them at all (rather than to analyze their potential
impact on non-deterministic results on a per-usage basis).

Apart from some obvious "things to avoid" (like, using a random value, or a wall-clock), please
observe the detailed rules below:

#### HashMap and HashSet usage

We explicitly **ban** the plain `HashMap` and `HashSet` usage from production code, including macro
definitions (i.e. these very structs may only be used in tests and test utilities).

However, hash-based structures are useful and have wonderful runtime characteristics, and actually
only introduce non-deterministic behaviors when iterated over. Hence, we provide the following
ways to use them:

- Inside **macro definitions**, **use the tree-based replacements** (`BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet`).
  - The reasoning is: macros are evaluated during compilation, so we do not need O(1) runtime
    performance, and we prefer to avoid pulling in dependencies to other alternatives.
- If you do **not need to iterate** over the collection (e.g. use a `HashMap` only in a "put + get"
  manner), then **use our custom wrapper** `NonIterMap`, which exposes the deterministic part of the
  `HashMap`'s API (i.e. excludes iteration).
- If elements of the iterated collection have some well-defined, intuitive natural ordering, then
  **use the tree-based replacements** (`BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet`).
- If you need to iterate over the collection in some **custom order** (e.g. order of insertion), or 
  if you do not care about the order at all, then **use the indexed alternative**, `IndexMap` (we
  export it from an external library).
  - It is essentially a `Vec`, with a `HashMap` on the side (for O(1) access), so it can accommodate
    arbitrary (re-)ordering of elements (having methods like `.move_index(from, to)` and
    `sort_by()`).
